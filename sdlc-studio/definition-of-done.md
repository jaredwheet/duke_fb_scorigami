# Definition of Done

> Under pressure cut scope, never weaken the bar. A Done that is only as strong as
> whoever remembered to check it is not a bar; every tagged criterion below is
> enforced by a gate that refuses.

## Story

A story or bug is Done when:

- [ ] Its executable acceptance criteria pass and are back-annotated [check: story.verify-ac]
- [ ] An independent critic APPROVE is recorded (author never reviews its own diff) [check: review.critic-approve]
- [ ] The adversarial pass is recorded as evidence and the reviewer of record has signed off [check: review.two-role]
- [ ] Its documentation landed in the same unit (help + reference for any new command/flag)
- [ ] The paperwork shipped in the same commit as the code (changelog fragment, status, index)
- [ ] If it is a REPAIR: a mutant was applied to its own changed lines and its test was seen
      to fail on that mutant. A fix's author is not sufficient evidence for that fix - the
      test is written after the answer is known, so it must be shown capable of failing.
      By default a survivor is FILED as a severity-rated bug and the unit still closes, so
      this box is about the evidence existing, not about the count being zero. Set
      `review.mutation_evidence: block` to make a survivor refuse instead
      [check: repair.mutation-evidence]

## Delivery batch

The review point. A batch of work reaching the project's commit threshold is done when:

- [ ] An independent review has covered THIS batch's units, and its reviewer is not its author
- [ ] Every finding it raised is filed against this batch, so the cost is priced where the work
      was rather than carried into the close
- [ ] A repair written in response to a finding is itself covered by a later batch review, never
      shipped self-reviewed

> The review belongs here, not at the close. A review that runs at the close makes every defect
> it finds close work by definition, and the close then costs more than the delivery it
> certifies - which is the fastest way to make a team stop closing at all.

## Sprint

A sprint is done when its close-down is complete:

- [ ] Every unit in the batch is covered by an independent review, ASSERTED not performed here
      [check: close.review-coverage]
- [ ] The batch retro exists and validates [check: close.retro]
- [ ] Lessons are extracted, revalidated, and the committed summary is current [check: close.lessons]
- [ ] The unified review is at least as new as every artefact [check: close.review]
- [ ] No index drift remains [check: close.reconcile]
- [ ] The Sprint Goal is judged (achieved / partial / missed), never defaulted

## Release

A release is done when:

- [ ] The full release gate is green [check: release.gate]
- [ ] Changelog fragments are composed into the release notes, no strays [check: release.changelog]
- [ ] Version strings agree across the authoritative files [check: release.version]
- [ ] The migration story for any breaking change ships with the change
