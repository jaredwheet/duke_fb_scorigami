## Notes

- An Issue is a **Discovery-backlog** item: a raw report or symptom, not yet reproduced or scoped. It carries a T-shirt **Size** (the discovery estimate) and a **Severity** (the urgency a triager prioritises on), but no story points - it is not a delivery unit.
- Lifecycle: **Open → Triaging → Triaged** (decomposed into bugs), then **Resolved** by DERIVATION when every child is resolved. Terminal: **Resolved / Closed / Won't Fix / Superseded**.
- Turn an Issue into deliverable work with `triage.py apply --issue IS-NNNN --bug 'title|points|severity'`; if it is really a change, file a CR and `refine` it instead.
- Issues are numbered globally (IS0001, IS0002, …). Cross-repo: confirm the next free number against `origin/main` before filing.
