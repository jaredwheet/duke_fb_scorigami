# duke_fb_scorigami - Agent Instructions

Duke FB Scorigami ingests Duke football data, detects unique scores, posts verified updates to X, and publishes scheduled email newsletters. This file is read at the start of
every session by your coding agent. It is the project's single source of truth for
how to work here; tool-specific files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
should point to it rather than duplicate it.

## Operating doctrine

This project runs on the **sdlc-studio** skill. Before substantive work:

1. Read `.claude/skills/sdlc-studio/reference-doctrine.md` - the project-agnostic
   operating rules (the SDLC is the operating system; files are truth, indexes are
   derived; reconcile cadence; TDD by default).
2. Read `sdlc-studio/reviews/LATEST.md` for current orientation.
3. Run `/sdlc-studio status` then `/sdlc-studio hint` for the next concrete step.
   (`status`/`hint` also surface a one-line notice if a newer SDLC Studio release
   exists - run `/sdlc-studio skill-update` to take it, or it stays quiet until the
   next release. Opt out with `version_check.enabled: false` in `.config.yaml`.)
4. Recall relevant cross-project lessons (`/sdlc-studio lessons recall`).

**After any context compaction or reset** (a `/compact`, `/clear`,
auto-summarisation, or a fresh session), re-read `sdlc-studio/reviews/LATEST.md`
and run `/sdlc-studio status` before continuing. That file is a state snapshot,
not a transcript, so it survives compaction and re-orients you in one read - in
any agent (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, opencode).

Do not restate the doctrine here. Capture below only what an agent cannot infer
from the code or the doctrine: this project's specifics.

## Non-negotiable gates

**IMPORTANT - never release to production until the full pre-release gate is green.**
In order, before tagging any release:

1. `/sdlc-studio reconcile --verify` - the executable AC gate. It runs every story's
   `Verify:` expression and fails on any `no` or `stale`. This is what makes "Done"
   mean done.
2. `/sdlc-studio review` - the full review set, **all five legs: PRD - TRD - TSD -
   Persona - CODE** (plus a **PVD** leg when the product spans repos and a
   `sdlc-studio/product/pvd.md` exists). The CODE leg is not optional; doc-only review
   never finds a crash bug, a deploy gap, or an untested hot path. The review confirms
   the **PRD requirements are met** (the Product Owner's sign-off) - and, where a PVD
   exists, the **PVD requirements are met** (the Product Manager's sign-off).

Triage and **fix** the findings before tagging. No exceptions - even a genuine
production hotfix files a `bug` (rationale + `Verify:` expression + audit pin).

**Review is independent of the author.** Whoever wrote the change never records its
sign-off. Two roles, never merged: an **adversarial reviewer** (a fresh context that
did not write the code) files findings as evidence, and a **reviewer of record** - the
operator, or a named delegate in a separate trust boundary - approves. With
`review.two_role_after` set in `.config.yaml`, a unit holds at Review until that
sign-off lands.

**Index & verification conventions.** Keep **one canonical status summary** per `_index.md` - the
`| Status | Count |` table with a `**Total**` row, which `reconcile` maintains. Per-section / per-epic
count tables are author-maintained; do not give them a `Total` row (reconcile would treat them as the
global summary). For a human-checked AC, write `Verify: manual <what to check>` so it is counted
*manual*, never shelled out - and never hand-stamp `Verified:` for an AC a machine did not check.

Every substantive change flows through the skill:
**CR / RFC -> Epic -> Story -> code plan -> code implement -> code verify ->
reconcile -> review.** No ad-hoc coding. Default to TDD: author the `Verify:`
expression or failing test first, then make it pass.

**The engagement floor (hard rule, not judgement):** when a change touches more than
one source file in this repo, derive the specification delta FIRST - name every
existing requirement the change interacts with and how each interaction is resolved -
and write acceptance criteria (one per interaction) before any code. Scale-to-size
judgement applies only above this floor. Why a rule: measured on the base models most
teams run, judgement-gated engagement produced the same defect rate as no process,
while the mandated pass cut it 4-5x for ~10-20% more tokens (see the skill's
benchmarks). Operators may opt out with `engagement_floor: judgement` in
`sdlc-studio/.config.yaml`; the default is the floor.

## How to work

1. **Think before coding.** State assumptions explicitly. If multiple readings exist,
   surface them rather than picking silently. If a simpler approach exists, say so.
2. **Simplicity first.** The minimum code that satisfies the story's acceptance
   criteria. Nothing speculative - no abstraction for single-use code, no
   configurability that was not asked for.
3. **Surgical changes.** Touch only what the story requires. Match the existing style.
   Ship the paperwork (PRD / TRD / capability tables) in the same commit as the code.
4. **Goal-driven autonomous execution.** Set the goal to complete every task in the
   approved plan or wave **autonomously, without human intervention**. The SDLC's own
   gates (consult, verify, test, check, reconcile) ARE the review - run each wave
   through to ship plus reconcile. Do not stop mid-execution. Stop only for: a genuine
   technical blocker the SDLC cannot resolve, an explicit operator pause, or a
   destructive / hard-to-reverse action (force-push, branch or table deletion, sending
   an external message).
   - **When you need another opinion, consult personas instead of stopping.**
     `/sdlc-studio consult team` (Three Amigos: Product Owner, Engineering, QA) on any epic or
     story design. `/sdlc-studio consult stakeholders` when the change touches the
     running system. Concerns are advisory - record them and proceed unless one is a
     hard technical blocker.
5. **Use the deterministic tooling - never hand-roll what it wires.**
   - **Bootstrap with `init`** (it creates the directory tree, the per-type `_index.md`
     files, config, and the agent-instructions). After `init` the first `new` of any type is
     indexed - a bare `indexed=false` means "no index yet", not "the tool does not index".
   - **Create every artifact with the non-interactive script - it is the canonical path:**
     `python3 <skill>/scripts/artifact.py new --type bug --title "..."
     --affects "a.py, b.py" --points 3` (same for cr / story / epic / rfc; a finding with
     repro + fix travels better through `scripts/file_finding.py file`). A bug or a CR must
     name the files it touches and its size - both creators refuse one that cannot be
     planned. It allocates a collision-free id, writes the file,
     appends the index row, and wires a story into its parent epic. The interactive
     `/sdlc-studio bug create` is a convenience wrapper that delegates to the same
     allocation - headless agents call the script. **Never hand-allocate ids or hand-author
     `_index.md`** - the file is truth, the index is derived. For many at once use
     `artifact.py batch` (one atomic pass).
   - **Pass prose as a document, not as a shell argument:** every writer that takes free
     text takes `--fields-file FIELDS.json` (or `-` to read it from stdin), because a
     backtick in a flag value is run by the shell rather than stored - see the script
     contract in `reference-scripts.md` for which writers and what the flag path still does.
   - **Fan out only over pre-wired scaffolds.** Delegated sub-agents fill **content**; the
     tool owns structure (ids, slugs, filenames, links, index).
   - **The index is derived:** run `reconcile` / `reconcile fields` / `validate` to sync;
     never hand-copy file-owned cells (story points, titles).
   - **A story reaches Done only when its executable ACs pass.** Author `Verify:` lines in the
     DSL (`jest`/`pytest`/`http`/`manual`) against the real runner; `transition -> Done` is
     gated on the verify result. Record load-bearing decisions in `decisions.md`, not scattered.
   - **Foundation first, then sprint.** Build the foundation epic by hand to a green gate
     (it sets conventions every later story inherits); sprint needs a runnable gate, so
     hand subsequent epics to `sprint --epic EPxx --goal done` once it is green.

## Project specifics

Fill these in. This is the part an agent cannot infer.

- **Stack:** JavaScript ES modules on Node.js 22; Jest 30 for tests; Supabase/Postgres for persistence; GitHub Actions for scheduled and manual jobs.
- **Run / build / test:** `npm ci`; `npm test`; `node src/index.js`; operational scripts include `npm run ingest`, `npm run detect:facts`, `npm run newsletter:test`, and `npm run newsletter:send`. There is no separate build step.
- **Deploy & CI:** Deployment is workflow-based rather than a long-running web service. `.github/workflows/scorigami-schedule.yml` runs the X workflow every 15 minutes, `newsletter.yml` runs newsletter delivery every 15 minutes, and the ingestion/test workflows are manually dispatched. Operational workflows run `npm ci` before their script; run `npm test` locally for code changes.
- **Config & secrets:** Local configuration is loaded from the ignored `.env`; GitHub Actions use repository secrets. Never commit `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `CFB_DATA_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, X/Twitter credentials, Resend credentials, recipient addresses, or other provider keys.
- **Code style:** Use the existing ES module style and Jest conventions. Keep score calculations, canonical facts, and numeric data deterministic and code-generated; AI may produce editorial wording only after validation. Keep server-only Supabase credentials out of client-facing code.
- **Architecture & services:** Batch-oriented Node scripts call College Football Data and optional external providers, persist canonical data and delivery state in Supabase, publish to X through the Twitter client, and render/send newsletters through Resend. Media-guide reference data lives under `data/`; SQL migrations live under `supabase/migrations/`.
- **Gotchas:** `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are required when `supabaseClient.js` is imported. `FAKE_DATE` and `BACKFILL_DAYS` alter scheduled behavior for local runs. Apply required Supabase migrations before using new persistence paths. Newsletter and ingestion jobs contact live services, while generated PDF extraction output under `data/generated/` is ignored.

## Don't

- Don't grow this file with per-ship narrative - that is what `git log`, spec detail
  blocks, and `sdlc-studio/reviews/LATEST.md` are for.
- Don't use a library from memory - query current API docs first; training data is stale.
- Don't mark a generated spec Done without tests. Generated specs are migration
  blueprints, not documentation, and never auto-promote to Done.
- Don't write a temp file to a shared, generically-named path when other agents may be
  running - a commit message, a fields-file, a worklist. Namespace it per agent or per run,
  or keep it inside your own worktree. A worktree isolates the tree, not `/tmp`: this has
  landed a commit carrying another agent's subject, in two consecutive sprints.
